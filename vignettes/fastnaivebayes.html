<div id="introduction" class="section level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Text classification is the task of classifying documents by their content: that is, by the words of which they are comprised. The documents are often represented as a bag of words. This means that only the occurrence and frequency of the words in the document are taken into account, any information about the syntactic structure of these words is discarded (Hu &amp; Liu, 2012). In many research efforts regarding document classification, Naive Bayes has been successfully applied (McCallum &amp; Nigam, 1998).</p>
<p>This package is a very fast implementation of the Naive Bayes classifier with the option to use two feature modeling distributions, as will be explained later on.</p>
</div>
<div id="naive-bayes" class="section level1">
<h1>Naive Bayes</h1>
<p>Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classification method based on the Bayes theorem with a strong and naive independence assumption. Naive Bayes assumes independence between all attributes. Despite this so-called “Naive Bayes assumption”, this technique has been proven to be very effective for text classification (McCallum &amp; Nigam, 1998). In the context of text classification, Naive Bayes estimates the posterior probability that a document, consisting out of several words, belongs to a certain class and classifies the document as the class which has the highest posterior probability: <span class="math display">\[P(C=k|D) = \frac{P(D|C=k)*P(C=k)}{P(D)}\]</span> Where <span class="math inline">\(P(C=k|D)\)</span> is the posterior probability that the class equals <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> given document, <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>. The Bayes theorem is applied to rewrite this probability to three components:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><span class="math inline">\(P(D|C=k)\)</span>, the conditional probability of document, <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>, given class, <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(P(C=k)\)</span>, the prior probability of class, <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(P(D)\)</span>, the prior probability of document, <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span></li>
</ol>
<p>To classify a document, <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>, the class, <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, with the highest probability is chosen as the classification. This means that we can simplify the equation a bit, since <span class="math inline">\(P(D)\)</span> is the same for all classes. By removing the denominator, the focus is now solely on calculating the nominator.</p>
<div id="the-prior" class="section level2">
<h2>The prior</h2>
<p>The prior probability of class, <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(P(C=k)\)</span>, is simply the proportion of documents in the training dataset that have class, <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>. For example, if our training dataset consists of 100 emails that have been labeled as either <span class="math inline">\(Ham\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(Spam\)</span> and there were 63 emails that were labeled <span class="math inline">\(Ham\)</span> and 37 emails labeled as <span class="math inline">\(Spam\)</span>. In this case, <span class="math inline">\(P(C=Spam)\)</span> is the proportion of emails that were labeled as <span class="math inline">\(Spam\)</span>, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(\frac{37}{100}=0.37\)</span>. This prior probability estimation is the same regardless of which distribution is used within the Naive Bayes Classifier.</p>
</div>
<div id="distributions" class="section level2">
<h2>Distributions</h2>
<p>Naive Bayes is a popular classification method, however, within the classification community there is some confusion about this classifier: There are two different generative models in common use, the multinomial Naive Bayes and Bernoulli Naive Bayes. Both are called Naive Bayes by their practitioners and both make use of the Naive Bayes assumption. However, they have different assumptions on the distributions of the features that are used. This means that these assumptions lead to two distinct models, which are very often confused (McCallum &amp; Nigam, 1998).</p>
<div id="bernoulli-distribution" class="section level4">
<h4>Bernoulli Distribution</h4>
<p>The most commonly used Naive Bayes classifier uses a Bernoulli model. This is applicable for binary features that indicate the presence or absence of a feature(1 and 0, respectively). Each document, <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>, consists of a set of words, <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> be the vocabulary, i.e. the collection of unique words in the complete dataset. Using the Bernoulli distribution, <span class="math inline">\(P(D_i|C=k)\)</span> becomes: <span class="math display">\[P(D_i|C=k) = \prod\limits_{t=1}^{|V|}{b_{i,t}*P(w_{t}|C=k)+(1-b_{i,t})*(1-P(w_{t}|C=k))}\]</span> Where <span class="math inline">\(b_{i,t}=1\)</span> if the document, <span class="math inline">\(D_i\)</span>, contains the word, <span class="math inline">\(w_t\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> otherwise. Furthermore, <span class="math inline">\(|V|\)</span> is the number of unique words in the dataset and <span class="math inline">\(P(w_{t}|C=k)\)</span> is the posterior probability of word, <span class="math inline">\(w_t\)</span> occuring in a document with class, <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>. This is simply calculated as the proportion of documents of class, <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, in which word, <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, occurs compared the total number of documents of class, <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>. In other words: <span class="math display">\[P(w_{t}|C=k)=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}{x_{i,t}*z_{i,k}}}{\sum_{i=1}^{N}{z_{i,k}}}\]</span> Where <span class="math inline">\(x_{i,t}\)</span> equals <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> if word, <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, occurs in document, <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> otherwise. Furthermore, <span class="math inline">\(z_{i,k}\)</span> equals <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> if document, <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, is labeled as class, <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> otherwise.</p>
</div>
<div id="multinomial-distribution" class="section level4">
<h4>Multinomial Distribution</h4>
<p>The multionomial distribution is used to model features, which represent the frequency of which the events occured, or in other words it uses word counts in the documents instead of the binary representation. This means that the distribution used to calculate <span class="math inline">\(P(D_i|C=k)\)</span> changes. This now becomes: <span class="math display">\[P(D_i|C=k) = \prod\limits_{t=1}^{|V|}{P(w_t|C=k)^{x_{i,t}}}\]</span> Where <span class="math inline">\(x_{i,t}\)</span> is the frequency of word, <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, in document, <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>. Here: <span class="math display">\[P(w_t|C=k)=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}{x_{i,t}*z_{i,k}}}{\sum_{s=1}^{|V|}{\sum_{i=1}^{N}{x_{i,s}z_{i,k}}}}\]</span> Where <span class="math inline">\(x_{i,t}\)</span> is the frequency of word, <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, in document, <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(z_{i,k}\)</span> equals <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> if document, <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, is labeled as class, <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> otherwise. Furthermore, <span class="math inline">\(|V|\)</span> is the length of the vocabulary, i.e. the total number of unique words in the dataset.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="laplace-smoothing" class="section level2">
<h2>Laplace Smoothing</h2>
<p>Another important aspect of Naive Bayes classifiers is the so-called Laplace smoothing. Consider again the probability calculation: <span class="math display">\[P(D_i|C=k) = \prod\limits_{t=1}^{|V|}{b_{i,t}*P(w_{t}|C=k)+(1-b_{i,t})*(1-P(w_{t}|C=k))}\]</span> If at any point <span class="math inline">\(P(w_t|C=k)=0\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(P(D_i|C=k)\)</span> will also equal <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>, since it’s a product of the individual probabilities. The same holds for the Multinomial distribution. In order to overcome this, Laplace smoothing is used, which simply adds a small non-zero count to all the word counts, so as to not encounter zero probabilities. There is a very important distinction to be made. A commonly made mistake is to assume that this is also applied to any features in the test set that were not encountered in the training set. This however, is not correct. The Laplace smoothing is applied, such that words that do not occur at all together wit a specific class do not yield zero probabilities. Features in the test set that were not encountered in the training set are simply ignored from the equation. This also makes sense, if a word was never encountered in the training set then <span class="math inline">\(P(w_t|C=k)\)</span> should be the same for every class, <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="why-is-it-so-fast" class="section level1">
<h1>Why is it so fast?</h1>
<p>As previously explained, when classifying a new document, one needs to calculate <span class="math inline">\(P(C=k|D_i) = \frac{P(D_i|C=k)*P(C=k)}{P(D_i)}\)</span> for each class, <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>. However, since the class with the highest posterior probability is used as the classification and <span class="math inline">\(P(D_i)\)</span> is constant for all classes, the denominator can be ignored. This means that for prediction, only <span class="math inline">\(P(D_i|C=k)*P(C=k)\)</span> needs to be calculated. As has been shown above this probability in the Bernoulli case can be rewritten to: <span class="math display">\[P(D_i|C=k) = \prod\limits_{t=1}^{|V|}{b_{i,t}*P(w_{t}|C=k)+(1-b_{i,t})*(1-P(w_{t}|C=k))}\]</span> By taking the log transformation this becomes: <span class="math display">\[log(\prod\limits_{t=1}^{|V|}{b_{i,t}*P(w_{t}|C=k)+(1-b_{i,t})*(1-P(w_{t}|C=k))}) = \sum_{t=1}^{|V|}{log(b_{i,t}*P(w_{t}|C=k)+(1-b_{i,t})*(1-P(w_{t}|C=k)))}\]</span> By rearranging some terms this becomes: <span class="math display">\[\sum_{t=1}^{|V|}{b_{i,t}*log(P(w_{t}|C=k))} + \sum_{t=1}^{|V|}{(1-b_{i,t})*log((1-P(w_{t}|C=k)))} \]</span> If we zoom in on the first part and keep in mind that our matrix, <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, with observations is a matrix where each column is a word, from <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(|V|\)</span>, with a <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> if the word was observed and <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> otherwise. This means that the matrix of observations has <span class="math inline">\(b_{i,t}\)</span> as the values. The probabilities, <span class="math inline">\(P(w_t|C=k)\)</span>, is a vector of length <span class="math inline">\(|V|\)</span>. We can now use matrix multiplication to derive the sum as follows: <span class="math inline">\(x * P(w_t|C=k)\)</span> for the first part and <span class="math inline">\((1-x) * (1-P(w_t|C=k))\)</span> for the second part. After these two parts have been added up, one can simply raise <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> to the power of the outcomes to transform it back to the original probabilities. This trick that allows one to use matrix multiplication is what makes this specific implementation so efficient.</p>
</div>
<div id="improvement-compared-to-e1071" class="section level1">
<h1>Improvement compared to ‘e1071’</h1>
<p>The go-to package for Naive Bayes classification in the R community is ‘e1071’. The main contribution of the fastNaiveBayes package is by improving on the work already done in ‘e1071’ on two points:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Speed of execution: by using the matrix multiplication trick this package is magnitudes faster</li>
<li>Also allows multinomial distribution modelling using the word frequencies.</li>
</ol>
<p>There is one caveat to this package compared to ‘e1071’, which is that a Gaussian distribution for numerical variables is not implemented (yet). This is because the matrix multiplication trick does not hold for a Gaussian distribution of numerical variables.</p>
<p>In order to demonstrate the power of this package a comparison of estimation and prediction execution times has been done using this package and been compared to ‘e1071’. The comparison was made on a dataset consisting of 14640 tweets, where 10980 were used to train the Naive Bayes classifier and 3660 tweets were used to test. After processing a total of 1881 features, i.e. words, were used. In the table below the comparison between execution times is shown</p>

<p>As can be seen from this table, the fastNaiveBayes algorithm using a normal R matrix was the fastest. Compared to the ‘e1071’ package the execution time is 331 times faster. It’s interesting to note that using a sparse dgcMatrix did not result in faster execution times for the Bernoulli distribution.</p>
<p>In the table below, the results are shown when using a Multinomial distribution and the word counts instead of binary features.</p>

<p>The comparison can not be made with the implementation in the ‘e1071’ package, since this does not implement a Multinomial distribution. The interesting thing to note here is that using a sparse dgcMatrix now gives a huge increase in performance. Comparing the median execution times using a sparse dgcMatrix is 36 times faster than the normal R matrix.</p>
