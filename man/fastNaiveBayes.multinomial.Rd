\title{Fast Naive Bayes Classifier with a Multinomial event model}
\usage{
fastNaiveBayes.multinomial(x, y, laplace = 0, sparse = FALSE, ...)

\method{fastNaiveBayes.multinomial}{default}(x, y, laplace = 0,
  sparse = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a numeric matrix with frequency counts. A sparse dgcMatrix is also accepted}

\item{y}{a factor of classes}

\item{laplace}{A number used for Laplace smoothing. Default is 0}

\item{sparse}{Use a sparse matrix? If true a sparse matrix will be constructed from x, which can give up to a 40% speed up.
It's possible to directly feed a sparse dgcMatrix as x, which will set this parameter to TRUE}

\item{...}{Not used.}
}
\value{
A fitted object of class "fastNaiveBayes.bernoulli". It has four components:

    \describe{
        \item{probability_table}{Posterior probabilities}
        \item{priors}{calculated prior probabilities for each class}
        \item{names}{names of features used to train this fastNaiveBayes}
    }
}
\description{
Extremely fast implementation of a Naive Bayes Classifier. This instance only uses the
Multinomial event model for all columns.
}
\details{
A Naive Bayes classifier that assumes independence between the feature variables. The multinomial distribution should
    be used when the features are the frequency that the feature occurs in each document.

    By setting sparse = TRUE the numeric matrix x will be converted to a sparse dgcMatrix. This can be considerably faster
    in case few observations have a value different than 0.

    It's also possible to directly supply a sparse dgcMatrix, which can be a lot faster in case a fastNaiveBayes model
    is trained multiple times on the same matrix or a subset of this. See examples for more details. Bear in mind that
    converting to a sparse matrix can actually be slower depending on the data.
