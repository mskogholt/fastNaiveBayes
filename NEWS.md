## fastNaiveBayes 2.2.1
### Bug Fixes
- Fix bug with class prediction of a single level

## fastNaiveBayes 2.2.0

### New Features
- update functionality to iteratively train models
- Poisson event model

### Bug Fixes
- Threshold parameter not working for gaussian

### Other Changes

## fastNaiveBayes 2.1.1

### New Features
- load and save options

### Bug Fixes
- Argument errors

## fastNaiveBayes 2.1.0

### New Features
- New naming structure
- User can specify priors

### Bug Fixes
- y not as factor caused vague error

### Other Changes
- Enriched unit tests

## fastNaiveBayes 1.1.2

### New Features
- threshold in all predict functions to ensure a minimum probability
- Added tweets and tweetsDTM datasets as example data and for time comparisons
- Changed Gaussian model to achieve a huge speed-up
- Removed inefficiencies for both the Bernoulli and Multinomial models. Much faster now.

### Bug Fixes
- With 2x1 matrices error were thrown

### Other Changes
- Removed std_threshold in Gaussian model, not necessary since the introduction of the above threshold feature
- Changed comparison to other packages in vignette

## fastNaiveBayes 1.1.1

### New Features
- Detect distribution. Automatically determine the distributions of a matrix for use with 
  mixed Naive Bayes model
- A threshold for the standard deviation for the Gaussian event model. This way one can ensure 
  that probabilities are real numbers and not NaN's due to standard deviation being 0.

### Bug Fixes

### Other Changes
- Expanded unit tests.
- Changed comparison to other packages in vignette
- small change to bernoulli predict function

## fastNaiveBayes 1.0.1

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed bug in Gaussian predict function.

### Other Changes
- Changed Readme
- Changed description
- Added unit tests and Travis-ci

## fastNaiveBayes 1.0.0
